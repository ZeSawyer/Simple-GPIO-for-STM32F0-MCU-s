* MCU: STM32F051R8T6. You might be able to use this also with STM32 F0 Cortex-M0 series. 
* This example uses CMSIS core, no HAL is used. 
* Reads an input (Input as pull down, default state of a pin is low) and blinks an LED once the input pin is detected as high.
* Please add stm32f051x8 header file in your CMSIS driver folder.
* Feel free to correct any mistakes I might have done.

The functions will accomplish the foolowing:  
* Sets output pins as push pull, medium speed and no pull up/ down 
* Sets Input pins as pull down, this means the the default state of a pin is low 
* Reads pin state and returns an integer. 1 for high level and 0 for low level 
* Sets pin state as high/ low
